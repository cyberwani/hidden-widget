Append a hidden div element at the end of the body, using a widget

== Description ==

A new widget called "Hidden HTML" is added to your widget list. The widget can be placed in any widget area, but instead of it being shown in the widget area, it is appended to the end of the body tag and surrounded with a hidden div.

This can be very useful when placing HTML or scripts in your page that you want to process later or to be used by other installed plugins or javascript code.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `hidden-widget.zip` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why not just use the text widget? =

The text widget places content inline, in the widget area you specify. This plugin appends html content to the end of the body, so that it can be processed later by other plugins or javascript. It also hides the content so that it does not interfere with the look of the website theme.
